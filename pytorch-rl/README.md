# pytorch-rl

Dockerfile with PyTorch, CUDA and various other RL-related libraries such as Stable-Baselines 3, Gymnasium, Weights&Biases and Tensorboard.

This configuration was originally used for experiments running Reinforcement Learning agents on control of large-scale Probabilistic Boolean Networks ([paper](https://openresearch.surrey.ac.uk/esploro/outputs/99710865302346), [code](https://github.com/uos-plccn/pbn-rl)), but currently has all the PBN-related stuff commented out.
